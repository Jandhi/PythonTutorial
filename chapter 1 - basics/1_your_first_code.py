# CHAPTER 1 - THE BASICS
# Section 1.1 - Your first code

# These files are python files
# They contain python code that can be run by the python interpreter to make stuff happen
# You will be able to run files in visual studio by pressing the "play" arrow on the top right of your screen

# COMMENTS
# ---

# Lines that start with '#' are comments. They will be ignored by the python interpreter.

pass # You can also add comments to the end of lines of code. Notice that "pass" in this line is actual python code. It doesn't actually do anything.

'''
For multi-line comments, you can use two sets of three apostrophes. Anything between these sets is a comment.

This is also a comment.

And so is this.

# STRINGS
# ---

'hello' # This is a String. Strings is how python stores text. To write a string, you must use single or double quotes.
"hello" # This is identical to the above. Just remember that you need to chose one or the other. It's also bad form to switch between them
# Personally, I prefer single quotes

# ---
# PRINTING
# ---

print('hello') # This is a print statement. It will print whatever is in the brackets. To make text appear to screen, you must print a string.
# This will make the program say hello in the terminal. Run this program to see that happen.

# ---
# ASSIGNMENT: HELLO WORLD
# ---

# Now that you know how to write a string and how to print it, try 
# Write a line of code that prints the string "hello world" to the screen
